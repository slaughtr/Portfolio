## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Open_
* _in_
* _a_
* _modern_
* _Browser_

_{This likely won't work on older browsers (such as Internet Explorer before 9, old Chrome or Firefox setups, etc.). You will also need to have javascript enabled.}_

## Known Bugs

_{Minor issues with overlap of a border by about a pixel.}_

## Support and contact details

_{If there's an issue, please email me at dslaughtr@gmail.com}_

## Technologies Used

_{HTML, CSS, javascript. Lots of bootstrap bits, such as the popovers and tooltips. I had a lot of fun with the gradients, so there's some webkit stuff littered throughout. Other than that, it's all simple-to-understand CSS and HTML!}_
